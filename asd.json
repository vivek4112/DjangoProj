		   [{"snippet":"The draw of this book, as it is with all of Agatha Christie\u2019s whodunits, is the ingenuity of the mystery itself...Agatha Christie has written dozens and dozens of murder mysteries, some better than others, but all brilliant. If that\u2019s your passion, you know where to look.",

		   {"snippet":"I really enjoyed this mystery, I actually found myself trying to piece together the mystery and solve it, and although I guessed whodunit, half way through the book, it was still a fun read and one of my favourite Christie mysteries to date...I\u2019d definitely read recommend this Christie book.",

		    {"snippet":"Murder on the Orient Express is, thankfully, another enjoyable \u2018whodunnit\u2019 from Agatha Christie. While reading most books, you never really know when you\u2019re going to find out the truth, but Agatha Christie is always straight with the reader.",

		     {"snippet":"It has been a long time since I read a (non-young adult fiction) book in a day, but this novel certainly sucked me in.  It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the characters...READ IT. It was a quick enjoyable read and I could definitely see reading more of Christie\u2019s novels, especially one featuring the pop-cultural icon Miss. Marple.",
